We provide the following codes for use:  
&ensp;&ensp; 1. align a dcd trajectory to a reference structure and output a npz file of aligned Cartesian coordinates.  
&ensp;&ensp; 2. build a VAE model  
&ensp;&ensp; 3. use HDBSCAN iteratively updating the latent space  
&ensp;&ensp; 4. plot the similarity heatmap used in our paper

for training DIKI.

## parameters
&ensp;&ensp;```is_aligned``` **bool**, 0 or 1. Whether the dcd trajectory is aligned. If the value is set as 0, the Cartesian coordinates matrix will aligned with the 1st structure in the trajectory, and the aligned results will be saved at ```aligned_npz```, otherwise the coordinates will be loaded from ```aligned_npz```.  
<br/> 
&ensp;&ensp;```is_warmedup``` **bool**, 0 or 1. Whether the VAE model is pretrained. If the value is set as 0, the model will be initiliazed and trained from the beginning, and the trained model will saved at ```warmed_up_model_path```, otherwise the model will be loaded from ```warmed_up_model_path```.   
<br/> 
&ensp;&ensp;```psf_file_path``` **str**. The path of topology file.    
<br/> 
&ensp;&ensp;```dcd_file_path``` **str**. The path of trajectory file.    
<br/> 
&ensp;&ensp;```aligned_npz``` **str**. The path of aligned coordinates, saved as npz file.    
<br/> 
&ensp;&ensp;```selection``` **str**. Atom selection language. Details can be found in [MDanalysis](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/selections.html) docs.   
<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;```warmed_up_model_path``` **str**. The path of warmed_up model, saved as h5 format.   
<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;```min_cluster_size``` **int**. A pararmter of [HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html), indicating the minimum size of a cluster, also called FFK in our paper.   
<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;```min_samples``` **int**. A pararmter of HDBSCAN, indicating the number of samples to calculate core distances.       
<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;```cluster_selection_method``` **str**. A pararmter of HDBSCAN, which can be set as "eom" or "leaf".    
<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;```sigma``` **int**. The percentile of probability density, playing a role of threshold for discarding high-free-energy clusters, also called CFK in our paper.    
<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;```DIKI_saved_path``` **str**. The path of DIKI model, saved as h5 format.     
<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;```lam``` **float**. The weight of KL loss, and ```2-lam``` indicates the weight of shrinking loss.    
<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;```DIKI_batch_size``` **int**. Batch size of iterative update of DIKI.    
<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;```DIKI_epochs``` **int**. Epochs of iterative update of DIKI.
